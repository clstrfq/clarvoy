## Notes
- Auth is handled via Replit Auth (use-auth hook).
- The app uses a "Blind Input" mechanism for judgments - strict UI separation needed.
- Admin endpoints (heatmap, audit logs) are implemented in UI even if backend endpoints are pending.
- Dark mode is the default aesthetic for "The Steward" governance tool.
